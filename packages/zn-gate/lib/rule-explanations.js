 * One table that says, in plain words, what each rule id in the evidence log means, why it
 * matters and whether a person has a command to go on. `zn why` reads it; the block messages
 * can reuse it, so a rule is explained in one place only.
 *
 * Rule ids come from the evidence log (lib/evidence.js): the rules engine (`pi:...`, `secret:...`),
 * the shield (`mcp_tool_changed`, ...) and the hooks (`hook-<event>-secret`, `hook-<event>-policy`).
 * An entry is { name, matters, allow }, where allow is one of:
 *   { command: 'secret set NAME', note }  a command the person can run in their own terminal
 *   { command: null, note, who }          no command exists; `who` says who decides
 * `allow` can be a function of the record, for a command that names something from it.
 * Only put a command here that exists in the CLI: test/why.test.js checks the verbs.
